# Preamble

I'm very hesitant to call this a *course*. It's more of an amalgamation of notes in preparation for my taking the exam. Nonetheless, my aim is to provide value to you, the reader, for free. 

Let's dive into the tentative list of tools, resources, etc.

# Anki

I've decided to include Anki first. It's my favorite tool albeit it's not exclusive to technology. I've learned to use this over the years as I was first introduced to it when I tried learning languages. In a nutshell, it's a Spaced-Repetition System [SRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition). I won't bore you with the details other than it's a method of which you're more apt to remember details if those details are presented to you interleaved over time. 

I use this to sentence mine, a language learning technique where you "mine" (i.e. extract) sentences from native content in your target language. How does this apply to IT? If I read documentation or any form of textbook and I feel that it would be a tested piece of information (EIGRP metrics, anyone?), then I'll create a flash card for it.

## Example:

Front: EIGRP uses a default Hello timer of [...] seconds.
Back: 5

Of course, I'll include much more detail. This is an extremely simple example. I think you can see the power of it. Honestly, I'd credit Jeremy's IT Lab for bringing this technique into the mainstream IT world.

# DevNet OCG

Yes, the Official Cert Guide. We all love them. At the moment, I'm approximately half way through this book. It's a decent primer. Cisco Press often runs sales. You can also find a copy on any other third-party site. 

# Cisco U DevAsc Course

My company purchased this for me a while back. I don't have much time left on it as it expires in a month, but I'm approximately a third of the way through. It's not my preferred style. We'll see if I continue with it. 

# Parting Thoughts

This is a very, very tentative list for my personal resources. As I progress, I'll add more resources in. I'll probably link them at the bottom of each section. By all means, this list isn't exhaustive. Everyone has different preferences and such. For example, I'm not very fond of video courses. I'd much rather read in-depth material.
