# Gamification of CCIE Studies

Let's face it. We're nerds, and we like data. So, I've decided to use Notion to track the amount of hours spent per category for the CCIE. There's really no reason to do so other than I think it would be an interesting reflection experiment in the future. Everyone floats around the 1,000-1,500 hour mark for their CCIE, but I suppose it's different for everyone and no one uses the same resources. My intent is to split them up into broad categories such as books, documentation, INE, labbing, etc. Honestly, the main benefit is to watch the number increment daily and receive some sense of motivation. I hear it's really difficult when you're several months in, you're facing an uphill battle, and you think you aren't making any progress. So far, it does feel good to enter my hours spent into the tracker even though I'm only at 11.5 at the time of writing this. It's the first week, and I'm slow rolling it. I'll study more hours some weeks than others. Good luck to everyone else out there!
